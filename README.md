# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction
The objective of the project is to predict the hotel booking status of the guest if it'll be cancelled or not based on the various features like ADR (Average Daily Rate), booking changes, lead time, type of the hotel booked, and more. The type of hotels given in the dataset is Resort Hotels and City Hotels.

The Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Analysis is done to get the insight about the data and answer some questions for example "Which is the busiest month of the year ?", "What is the average price of the room per person per night ?" and more. The correlation heatmap is plotted as well to see the most important features and the features are taken based on that.
